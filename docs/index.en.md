# ChatVoice Docs

ChatVoice is a ChatArch Python package that packages the Speakr recording, transcription, meeting-notes, and voice-workspace service into an installable, maintainable, API-readable runtime.

## Core entries

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **Deployment and Startup**

    From `python -m pip install "ChatVoice[web]==0.1.11"` to `chatvoice serve app`, including runtime paths, account provisioning, ASR API provider wiring, and database concurrency boundaries.

    [Read deployment guide](deployment.md)

- **API Access**

    Browser login, API token lifecycle, and `chatvoice data ...` reads for meeting transcripts, meeting summaries, and realtime conversation records.

    [Read API access](api-access.md)

- **Runtime Layout and Data Structure**

    `site-packages` install path, `~/.chatarch/chatvoice` runtime root, SQLite tables, IndexedDB, `temp/asr`, and `model-cache`.

    [Read runtime layout](runtime-layout.md)

- **Recording Storage Boundary**

    The meeting recorder saves text and summaries only. It does not save original recordings; future pure-recording support should be designed as a separate capability.

    [Read recording storage boundary](recording-storage.md)

- **Voice Cloning Guide**

    Complete workflow for reference-audio upload/recording, new text entry, progress, preview playback, download, and current one-shot boundaries.

    [Read voice cloning guide](voice-cloning.md)

- **CLI Tree**

    The real implemented command tree, command status, and update rules.

    [Read CLI tree](cli-tree.md)

- **Capability Map**

    Review current package boundaries and avoid presenting planned work as implemented functionality.

    [Read capability map](capability-map.md)

- **Python Interface Tree**

    Keep the CLI thin and put substantive behavior in importable Python APIs.

    [Read interface tree](interface-tree.md)

## v0.1.11 deployment boundary

- The packaged FastAPI app starts with `chatvoice serve app`.
- Fresh start can create invited accounts with `chatvoice accounts add`; no source-tree script is required.
- Signed-in users can create API tokens in the web UI; the CLI can use tokens to read meetings, summaries, and realtime conversations.
- Signed-in users can upload or record authorized reference audio in Voice Studio and run a one-shot VoiceClone/IndexTTS-2.5 preview through the hitk sidecar.
- The meeting recorder does not save or download original recordings; the server stores text, summaries, and metadata only.
- Production ASR should use `api-server` against a managed API or self-hosted GPU ASR server.
- `stub-local` is only for credential-free / GPU-free contract smoke.
- v0.1.11 defaults to SQLite WAL for one service process and light concurrency; high-concurrency storage migration needs a separate release.
